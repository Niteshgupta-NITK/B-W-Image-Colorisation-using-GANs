# BW-Image-Colorisation-using-GANs
Ongoing project for the academic year 2020-21.

## Description
The project aims to develop a Generative Adversarial Network capable of colorizing black and white
images and experiment with methods to improve performance. With the advent of Deep Convolutional
Networks and especially the rise of Generative Adversarial Networks, there has been an
increasing interest in this field to automate the above task while producing results that
can satisfactorily fool a human. Our project aims to improve the performance of an
existing implementation of the same, with different training methodologies.
